# ReactWeatherApp
I created a weather app. This app is built in ReactJS and it uses data from OpenWeather API. I have written a backend side in NodeJS and a frontend side in React.
I will describe how to launch my app. For beginning we need to clone the repository. 
Now we need to do a few steps:
- In VS Code we need to open a folder with this project.
- Create a concole and type: 
  cd backend
  npm i
  node server.js
- When we finished with our backend side we need to launch a client side.
- We need to create a new console in VS Code and type:
  cd client
  npm i
  npm start
- When all steps will be completed you can use my app.
